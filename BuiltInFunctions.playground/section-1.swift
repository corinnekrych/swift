/*

Swift has 74 built-in functions but only seven of them are documented in the Swift book (“The Swift Programming Language”). The rest remain undocumented.

This article lists all built-in Swift functions – both documented and undocumented ones. The definition used for “built-in function” used in this article is a function available in Swift without importing any modules (such as Foundation, etc.) or referencing any classes.
