In Swift, there are two kinds of types: named types and compound types.
A named type is a type that can be given a particular name when it is defined.
Named types include classes, structures, enumerations, and protocols.

Data types that are normally considered basic or primitive in other languages—such as types that represent numbers,
characters, and strings—are actually named types, defined and implemented in the Swift standard library using structures.
Because they are named types, you can extend their behavior to suit the needs of your program,
using an extension declaration, discussed in Extensions and Extension Declaration.

A compound type is a type without a name, defined in the Swift language itself. There are two compound types: function types and tuple types. A compound type may contain named types and other compound types. For instance, the tuple type (Int, (Int, Int)) contains two elements: The first is the named type Int, and the second is another compound type (Int, Int).
