//: # Value type vs Reference type
//: Swift has two categories of Types: Value and Reference.
//: - **Value type** is a type whose value is **copied** when it is assigned to a variable or constant, or when it is passed to a function.            ‚Å£
//: - **Reference types** are not copied when they are assigned to a variable or constant, or when they are passed to a function. 
//: Rather than a copy, a reference to the same existing instance is used instead. 

//: It's good to see to which category each construct belongs to</p>
//:
//: **Value types:**
//: - struct
//: - enum
//: - tuple
//:
//: **Reference types:**
//: - class
//: - function

//: #### By reference or by value?
//: Basics types, as Int, are value types, but in Swift the data structures like Array and Dictionary  <br/>
//: are also value types (implemented as Struct behind the scenes).
